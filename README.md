# Metrics Outliers
ASYM0B (A framework for SYsteMatically assessment Of chatBots) is a framework to analyse and assess conversational agents or chatbots built in different tools. To support chatbots from different platforms, ASYM0B relies on a neutral chatbot definition called [CONGA](https://saraperezsoler.github.io/CONGA/). In this [link](https://github.com/ASYM0B/tool)  there are ASYM0B environments, which can be used with these chatbots files.

This repository contains the result of analysing [a dataset](https://github.com/ASYM0B/Dataset) of Dialogflow and Rasa chatbots. The analysis is based on the measurement of the chatbot designs using [ASYM0B](https://github.com/ASYM0B/tool), calculating metric outliers, and identifying problems within such outlier sets.
