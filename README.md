# Metrics Outliers
ASYM0B (A framework for SYsteMatically assessment Of chatBots) is a framework to analyse and assess conversational agents or chatbots built in different tools. To support chatbots from different platforms, ASYM0B relies on a neutral chatbot definition called CONGA. In this link there are ASYM0B environments, which can be used with these chatbots files.

This repository has an excel file that contains a table with the outliers values of several metrics taken with Asymob
